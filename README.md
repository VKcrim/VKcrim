Hello everyone, I'm @VKCrim...
I enrolled at CS50x without any experience and trying to grasp the most basic concepts of programming...
I do learn from clear examples or solutions since I'm very green :)
My goal isn't becoming a programmer per say but to gain knowledge and understand what these amazing people do with their skill set.
Therefore I can understand how some of the tools are built which I may use in science projects involving analysing empirical data.

From 2022-08-30 I started learning solely python through CS50P, and not only understanding but actually applying myself without anyone's direct help.
